                <p><b>Photosynthesys</b> is a chemical process that uses sunlight to turn carbon dioxide into sugars the plant cell can use as energy. As well as plants, many kinds of algae, protists and bacteria use it to get food.</p>

                <p>Photosynthesis is very important for life on Earth. Most plants either directly or indirectly depend on it. The exception are certain organisms that directly get their energy from chemical reactions; these organisms are called chemoautotrophs.</p>

                <p>Photosynthesis can happen in different ways, but there are some parts that are common.</p>

                <p>Photosynthesis has two main sets of reactions. Light-dependent reactions need light to work; and light-independent reactions, which do not need light to work.</p>

                    <h2>Light-dependent reactions</h2>

                    <p>Light energy from the sun is used to split water molecules (photolysis). The sunlight hits chloroplasts in the plant, causing an enzyme to break apart the water. Water, when broken, makes oxygen, hydrogen, and electrons.</p>

                    <p>Hydrogen, along with electrons energized by light, converts <i>NADP</i> into <i>NADPH</i> which is then used in the light-independent reactions. Oxygen diffuses out of the plant as a waste product of photosynthesis, and <i>ATP</i> is synthesized from <i>ADP</i> and inorganic phosphate. This all happens in the grana of chloroplasts.</p>

                <article>
                    <h2>Light-independent reactions</h2>

                    <p>During this reaction, sugars are built up using carbon dioxide and the products of the light-dependent reactions (<i>ATP</i> and <i>NADPH</i>) and various other chemicals found in the plant in the <u>Calvin Cycle</u>. Therefore, the light-independent reaction cannot happen without the light-dependent reaction. Carbon dioxide diffuses into the plant and along with chemicals in the chloroplast, <i>ATP</i>, and <i>NADPH</i>, glucose is made and finally, transported around the plant by translocation.</p>
